Originally a human Thran from the continent of Terisiare on the plane of Dominaria, Gix was converted into a Phyrexian Demon by Yawgmoth himself during the events of the Thran-Phyrexian War. His demon body was built of bone, machine parts, and soft meat.Gix first appeared during the final years of the ancient Thran Empire as a human rebel operating out of the Caves of the Damned, a network of tunnels beneath the Thran capital that served as home to the outcasts of Thran society.[1] Most of these outcasts, including Gix, suffered from a deadly sickness known as phthisis, which was caused by radiation from powerstones, the very energy source that fueled the Thran Empire and all its technological advancements.Channeling the anger and resentment of the outcasts, Gix ambushed and attempted to assassinate Glacian, the genius Thran artificer who had pioneered powerstone technology. He stabbed Glacian with a powerstone shard, thus infecting him with the same radiation sickness that afflicted the outcasts in the Caves of the Damned.As Glacian's health deteriorated over the next few years, his wife, the Thran architect Rebbec, summoned the exiled medical prodigy Yawgmoth back to the capital to treat him. During this time, Gix led multiple violent uprisings in the capital, but in the end, his rebellion was pacified by Yawgmoth, who finally devised a cure for phthisis and offered to share it with the sick inhabitants of the Caves of the Damned. Using the cure as leverage, Yawgmoth was able to coerce an oath of loyalty from Gix, who, in return for the phthisis cure (and his life), vowed to serve Yawgmoth faithfully forever.After the founding of Phyrexia by Yawgmoth, Gix became one of the first living beings to be Compleated, shucking aside his humanity to become a Phyrexian monstrosity and rising to serve as Yawgmoth's right-hand man throughout the Thran-Phyrexian War. At the conclusion of the War, he was banished from Dominaria along with all of Yawgmoth's minions, trapped on the mechanical plane of Phyrexia when the Thran architect Rebbec closed the portal connecting Phyrexia to Dominaria. The Thran Empire collapsed in the War's aftermath, but Yawgmoth, Gix, and the other Phyrexians remained sealed away from Dominaria for eons. Augmenting themselves with machinery and dark technology, the Phyrexians transcended their former mortal lifespans. Over the millennia that followed, Gix became a powerful demon and praetor while his master, Yawgmoth, ascended to become a god deep within the core of the plane."

"for Yawgmoth couldn't let someone who planned to destroy Phyrexia go unpunished. Urza was eventually healed by Serra,",
"but after he left the Phyrexians even invaded her realm and corrupted it. Then Freyalise, desperate to be free from the Shard,",
"cast the World Spell, opening Dominaria to Yawgmoth once again. He released Gix from his torment since he knew",
"more about fighting Urza and infiltrating Dominaria than anyone else, but while Gix was initially successful Urza returned to his homeplane as well."
"He first destroyed all Sleeper Agents and then killed Gix. In the wake of his latest setback,",
"Yawgmoth set about concocting a different plan: instead of infiltrating Dominaria,",
"he would prepare for a full-blown invasion. He started to amass an army and created the artificial plane of Rath,",
"which he planned to fill with troops and then merge with Dominaria, placing all his forces there in a single moment.",
"Even as he set his new plan into motion, Yawgmoth continued to send troops after Urza, recognizing him as one of the greatest threats to his plans.",
"One of the more successful ones was K'rrik, a Sleeper Agent who tracked down Urza's academy on Tolaria,",
"where mages were trained and artifacts were built to fight Phyrexia. K'rrik succeeded in destroying the place,",
"but Urza sent the silver golem Karn back in time to prevent this. He succeeded,",
"but the time machine overheated and destroyed the academy nonetheless.",
"When Urza returned ten years later he found that the time streams of the island had been twisted. In some places,",
"ten thousand years happened in a single second, in others, it was the other way around. Trapped inside a fast-time bubble,",
"K'rrik had ages to prepare for an attack on Urza, but the planeswalker eventually managed to",
"defeat him with the help of the nature spirit Multani. While the evincars of Rath started to overlay small parts of the plane with Dominaria",
"in preparation for the coming invasion, the artificial plane filled up with beings from Dominaria and other planes on which the Phyrexians could experiment.",
"Among them were the Kor, humans with strange elongated skulls. When the Inner Circle member Croag,",
"who oversaw the progress of the plane, discovered humans with Phyrexian traits in them in Benalia,",
"the truth about the Kor was revealed: Urza had started the Bloodline project,",
"a grand plan to manipulate the breeding patterns of several groups of Dominarians to create perfect warriors to fight Phyrexia.",
"The project resulted in ordinary humans with an affinity for tracking down and fighting Phyrexians, and in the Metathran,",
"genetically engineered warriors with no will of their own, eerily similar to the Phyrexians they were designed to fight.",
"After discovering this, Yawgmoth increased the raids on Dominaria, tracking down the Bloodline results and killing them.",

"such as Gerrard, the true heir to Urza's Legacy, a collection of artifacts made for the single purpose of destroying Yawgmoth.",
"The attacks became so frequent at times that they started to play a role in local myths. Stories about the Lord of the Wastes,",
"a machine lord who waged eternal war on Dominaria, started to spread from Benalia to Jamuraa. After many centuries of preparation,",
"Yawgmoth finally launched his full-scale invasion of Dominaria in 4205 AR. Throughout most of the invasion,",
"Yawgmoth remained within the depths of Phyrexia while his minions Crovax and Tsabo Tavoc commanded the Phyrexian armies in battle.",
"Tsabo Tavoc's plagues and shock troops devastated numerous Dominarian nations,",
"while Crovax oversaw the overlay of the plane of Rath onto Dominaria, bringing millions of additional Phyrexian",
"soldiers and monstrosities to assault the beleaguered world. Yet even as Phyrexia wore down Dominaria’s nations,",
"the defenders managed to fight for months on end, delaying Phyrexia’s victory. In the face of continued resistance,",
"Yawgmoth became convinced that his ultimate foe was not Urza, but the living spirit of Rebbec herself,",

"Yawgmoth finally returned to Dominaria for the first time in 9000 years. He did so in the form of a black,",
"world-spanning death cloud that killed Dominaria's defenders and resurrected them to fight for Phyrexia.",
"But there was still hope for the plane: even as Yawgmoth's black spirit wrapped around the entire world and prepared to crush it in his grasp,",

"Seeing the Weatherlight transfigured and wreathed in beaming white mana like a divine being,",
"Yawgmoth no longer recognized it as Urza's skyship but instead perceived it to be the soul of Rebbec,",
"the protector of Dominaria and his opposite. Resolving to possess and destroy Rebbec at last,",
"Yawgmoth summoned a storm of giant black tentacles that erupted from the black clouds and attacked the Weatherlight.",
"Undeterred, Gerrard took out Urza's gemstone eyes - the two halves of the powerstone that had locked out Yawgmoth and",
"contained the spirit of Glacian - and placed them in the cavities in Karn's chest, completing the Legacy.",
"The exact working of the Legacy device is unknown, but it created a sentient light that exploded from the Weatherlight",
"and dissolved Yawgmoth's death-cloud form, killing him at last. 101 years later, the godlike being Karona was looking for",
"other beings like her. She first summoned a 'god' for each color of magic, and the black one appeared to be Yawgmoth.",
"Later she traveled across the planes and ended up in Phyrexia, devastated by the Nine Titans, but still holding together.",
"There she met a disembodied voice claiming to be Yawgmoth, suggesting that he was still alive and needed her help to rebuild.",
"However, subsequent canon sources have explicitly confirmed Yawgmoth's death, and given Karona's unstable nature,",
"this supposed encounter was likely just a manifestation of her warped psyche. Alternatively, the whispering voice",
"might have been a lingering echo or faded memory of the dead god's former power in Phyrexia. Given Karona's",
"near-omnipotence and unique power to shape reality, it's conceivable that she alone might have been able to resurrect",
"Yawgmoth and restore his broken plane had she truly wished. In any case, she declined to do so,",
"recoiling in horror from Phyrexia and fleeing its shattered husk."
